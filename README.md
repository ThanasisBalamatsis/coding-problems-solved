# coding-problems-solved
This is a collection of selected coding problems that I've solved since June 2021, when I decided to pursue a career in programming. This repo is the result of personal time dedicated to something that utterly fascinates me and offers moments of clarity and creativity.

They are mainly written in Python and I encountered them in MIT's online course "6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python" and on codewars.com. As I gradually develop my C# skills, problems written in C# will be added.
