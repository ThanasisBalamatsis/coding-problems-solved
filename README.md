# coding-problems-solved
This is a collection of selected coding problems that I've solved since June 2021, when I decided to pursue a career in programming. This repo is the result of personal time dedicated to something that utterly fascinates me and offers moments of clarity and creativity.

The problems are not presented in chronological order and do not constitute the totality of problems I've solved. They are mainly written in Python and I encountered them in the context of MIT's online course "6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python" and on codewars.com. As I gradually develop my C# skills, I intend to add problems written in C#.
